description: Shortcuts to save some valuable time

> Most of the tips may already be known to people using computers for quite some time. Have a quick look if you can find something new.

Almost all of us use some sort of internet enabled device. So, its important that we spend our time doing the important task at hand, rather than wasting our time using the device to get it done.

Now since our busy life demands us to save our time, here I provide some shortcuts and smart techniques to get things done fast.

Most of these tips are not known to infrequent computer users and hence are focused on them.

## Computers
I spend most of my time in front of a computer screen. For me, knowing the below mentioned shortcuts are critical for **efficiency**.

#### Selecting text
Don’t waste time in clicking and then dragging the mouse to select a word or a paragraph. Instead use **double click** and **triple click**.

Use **double-click** to select a word and **triple-click** to select a paragraph.

While typing, don’t keep pressing the backspace key to delete a piece of text. Rather use the combination of **Shift + Ctrl + Left Arrow** keys to select a piece of text in increments of a word and delete it using the **Backspace** key.

If you want to replace a piece of text, select it and then start typing the new text rather then deleting the selected text and then typing the new text. This will automatically replace the selected text with the one you type.

Instead of dragging to select a piece of text, double click and then drag to select text in increments of one word.

#### Navigating text
Rather then using the **left** and the **right** key to navigate text, use the **Ctrl + Left/Right** keys to traverse in increments of one word.

To reach the end or the start of a line use the **end** and the **home** keys respectively, rather than pressing the **left** or the **right** key till you reach the start or the end.

#### Page Scrolling
Use the **Space** and the **Shift + Space** keys to scroll down and scroll up respectively one page at a time. Don’t use the scroll button on your mouse, its a waste of time.

#### Others
When filling forms use the **tab** key to switch to the next form field. Using the mouse to do so is a terrible waste of time.

When selecting an option from a list of options don’t use your mouse to expand it and then select your option (not if you don’t know the options), rather use **tab** to focus it and then press the first letter on the keyboard until you get your desired option selected.

Want to know what the weather report has to tell the temperature in your locality, just search for **weather the-city** on google to find it out.

Just encountered a word not known to you, just search for **define the-word** on google to find out what it means.

## Mobile Phones
If you wish to call a person you just called, just press the call button and the number of the person you just called will be entered in the dial pad. Just press the call button again to call. (Some mobile phones, may call the person the first time you press the call button)

While typing a piece of text if you wish to end the sentence, don’t type `.` and then a space. Rather double tap the space button quickly to solve the purpose.

I hope these tech tips will save your valuable time.
